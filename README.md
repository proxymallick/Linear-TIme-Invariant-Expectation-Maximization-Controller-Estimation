Maximum Likelihood Controller Estimation for unknown multi-variableDynamical systems for Linear TIme Varying as well as LInear TIme Invariant Systems
For Running these particular codes you need to have a **Guided Policy Search Algorithms** initialized in your system. You can also download the data sets and then try on it. In our case we are referring to the explicit code by Guided Policy Search by **Levine, Sergey, and Vladlen Koltun. "Guided policy search." International Conference on Machine Learning. 2013**  
We set up the experiments by using the GUI developed in the paper referred above, but we entirely write our code for EM-Kalman and test it on our platform. Sample codes are also given. At the point the codes might be haphazard but it will soon be organised. 
We use their platform to change the
