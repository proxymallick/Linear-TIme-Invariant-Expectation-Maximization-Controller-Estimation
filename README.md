Maximum Likelihood Controller Estimation for unknown multi-variableDynamical systems for Linear TIme Varying as well as LInear TIme Invariant Systems
For Running these particular codes you need to have a **Guided Policy Search Algorithms** initialized in your system. You can also download the data sets and then try on it. In our case we are referring to the explicit code by Guided Polciy Search by **Levine, Sergey, and Vladlen Koltun. "Guided policy search." International Conference on Machine Learning. 2013**
